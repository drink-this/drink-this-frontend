**Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):**  
Molly: Get this alogrithm working and to work in python. Understanding machine learning. Would be stoked to get some of the extensions working and functional.

Richard: Get out of the project on python and machine learning. Brush up on full stack skills.

Taija: Get experience in tech stack not familiar (REACT, Python). Achieve MVP to a professional level. App works to be successful!

Jermaine: Touch on new frameworks. Get addtional knowledge on REACT and python.

Zach: Work on UX and design. Collaboration overall. 

Mark: To learn some python and frontend. Also, mostly to learn from teammates.


**Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):**  
Molly: Somewhat familiar with the components with this project. Generally organized; like to do a lot of reading before diving into code. Will share any materials.

Richard: Great at writing documentation. Support team this way. Keep kanban board clean; use best practices. General support if anyone needs in both backend/frontend.

Taija: Facilitate communication on team; make sure everyone is on same page. Looking for more pairing since there is a lot of unfamiliar languages. Very organized as well.

Jermaine: Learning and go with flow. Good motivate and have different perspective in approaching problems.

Zach: Can get into problems and solve them quickly. Do best in meetings first and get things going. Supportive.

Mark: Here to learn. Can type fairly quickly in code. Into pairing. 

**How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:**  
We feel like our strengths mesh very well together. We will ask questions when we run into an issue. Help each other out.

**Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):**  
Molly: Open to get up early to work; 7a - 9p-ish; Weekend: open to work

Richard: 9a - 9p; sometimes push to 10p or 10:30p. Give a eveyone a days notice if something comes up. Weekend: give self time for brain to unravel (4-6hrs) to decompress

Taija: 9a - 9p MT; if anyone working early, please ping in channel. Want to be presence as possible. Please communicate. Weekend: Try to give husband a break; flexible-ish; communicate first

Jermaine: Before 5a, will be up; 5a (1p Netherlands) - 6p (2a Netherlands; coding time), vary depending on what is needed. Weekend: Open to work.

Zach: always round... 24/7-ish

Mark: 7a - 12a... breaks (45min-1hr) for lunch, dinner, 4-ish to walk dog, 9:30-ish - 10:15-ish to chat with the lady friend. Weekend: Open to work.

**Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):**  
Slack, create threads to break down into chunks (ie, frontend vs backend, materials to read/research, etc). Pin conversations to easily find stuff.

**Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):**  
See above. 

**Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):**  
REACT, python, JS, Tailwind, Circle CI

**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):**   
Using Github project board to manage project. GitKraken?
PR template: use one posted in Slack
Code Review: PRs - two reviews (one review from opposite team)
Documentation: cross-over reviews (backend reveiws frontend documentation, vice versa)
Debugging/Problem-solving: Zach and Richard are here (guardian angels) :D
Linter: integrate to CI/CD (will auto-format)

**Pomodoro Break Schedule:**  
Take breaks (esp, Richard and Zach)

**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:**  
Molly: Welcomed; receive feedback later; interested in learning; no help until unproductive struggle; once PR or after, welcome feedback for anything (code, process, etc)

Richard: Love to give constructive feedback (usually on PRs); Will guide through changes needed; Love to receieve questions (don't just look at code; ask the why)

Taija: same as Molly; will actively ask for help; welcome a lot of feedback; appreciate thorough PR reviews; will do her best to review; won't take personal if you have a criticism

Jermaine: vocal on what he doesn't know; like to be guided; exploring, but sometimes need a specific thing and will communicate

Zach: Github/PRs/chat... need time to provide response; tell him if he is stepping on toes; can be forceful, so be forceful and won't take personally

Mark: expect harmony, try give constructive feedback (if I know something); I welcome feedback to any degree; try to contribute whatever I can

### Additional Remote Considerations:

**Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):**  
Github (project board), GitKraken, Slack (use threads)

**Day 1 Agenda:**  
Completed DTR and start coding (on day 2 - 2021 Jul 27, Tue).
Day 1: Wireframes; Frontend stories (complete)
Day 2: Backend stories and some coding.
